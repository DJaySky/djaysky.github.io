			<p>
				The Darkest Armory is a repetitive game about delving deep into dungeons to find loot. Your task as simple: get as much gold as you can before your untimely death. How much gold can you find?<br><br>

				Controls:<br>
				Enter - pause game<br><br>

				Menus:<br>
				Up/Down Arrows - navigate menu<br><br>

				Z/X/C - select option<br>

				In Game:<br>
				Left/Right Arrows - turn 90 degrees<br><br>

				Up Arrow - walk forward<br><br>

				How to Play:<br>
				Inside of the dungeon, you will find health packs and treasure chests. As your health drains every three steps, you will need to pickup health packs to keep yourself from dying. Picking up a treasure chest will give you  a randomly generated item, with a randomly generated value. Be careful though, as you can only carry so many items before you start having to drop them!<br><br>

				When you have enough items, you will need to make it back up to the very top of the dungeon,  where you can sell your objects to the local store. Simply climb up the ladder where you spawned, and you can sell your loot. If you die with loot in your inventory, it is lost forever, so make sure to be selling (and saving) often.
